# CourseCompass AI — Your next chapter

A career and learning navigator for students in Pakistan, spanning intermediate and O/A-level pathways through undergraduate study and job preparation.

**Explore → choose a direction → understand requirements → build skills → save a practical plan.**

- Nine cross-disciplinary degree paths with comparison and trial activities.
- University exploration with location/budget filters, source links, IBCC-aware checks and a limited sourced NET calculator.
- Pasted-job skill analysis and clearly labelled example role briefs.
- Free learning resources connected to practice tasks, progress and Markdown export.
- Contextual Gemini adviser with consent and an explicitly labelled guided fallback.
- Supabase authentication and PostgreSQL persistence with RLS; temporary guest mode when unconfigured.

Stack: React, TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind, shadcn/Base UI, Supabase PostgreSQL, optional free-tier Gemini. A separate Vinext adapter supports Sites hosting. No paid APIs are required. No SQLite replacement or fake cloud-save success.
